# Turtle Spirals 🌀




“Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it. This module comes packed with the standard Python package and need not be installed externally.



A spiral is a curved pattern that focuses on a center point and a series of circular shapes that revolve around it. Examples of spirals are pine cones, pineapples, hurricanes.
